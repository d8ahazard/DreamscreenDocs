# DreamscreenDocs
A public repository to house information regarding the now-dead line of Dreamscreen products

## What it is

My personal repository of all things related to dreamscreen, just so I don't have to constantly hunt around
on the web or my PC to find something.

## What's here

* Firmwares from the latest (beta) version of the Android dreamscreen app for all devices.
* A non-working, decompiled version of the Android app with the source code mostly reversed back to java...but not entirely,
and not enough to build a running app...yet. ;)
* The device code from the app, converted to c#. They're incomplete, but have all the hooks there to make a full dreamscreen app/emulator/whatever
* Documentation
** The original V4 Wifi Protocol document from DS
** An edited version of the V4 (V5) Protocol document, with an expanded command list and more comprehensive info on what the various bits in the state messages are
** A handy "status decoder" spreadsheet. Paste a hex string (no separators) into one of the fields, and use the guide on the left side 
to determine the values in the message.
